/* Use this program to run your test cases for homework 6.  We are looking 
 * at hash functions and the number of collisions we might have in a data 
 * set.  
 * 
 * The provided input file is text and contains 400 randomly generated
 * names.  You may generate a larger data set using http://www.randat.com/.
 * The data set was created 200 names at a time, a limitation of the website.
 * The data was then exported as xls files, and the contents were combined
 * into a single file.  I then used MicroSoft Excel to export the file as a 
 * tab delimited text file, which I edited by replaing the tab with a space 
 * and removing the header line and ensuring the final name has a newline.
